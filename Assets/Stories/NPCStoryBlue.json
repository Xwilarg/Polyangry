Being clad in a formal suit and blue of all colors, his presence stands out in the never-ending yellows and reds of the wasteland. ","#","^speaker none","/#","\n","^\"Well well, who do we have here…? Have you, by any chance, lost your way, miss?\" ","#","^speaker blue","/#","\n","^\"Not as much as you might be, based on your clothes\", she scoffed back. ","#","^speaker mc","/#","\n","^\"Is that how a passionate fisher should speak to someone? I’d imagine someone like you as more calm and composed, since catching something, anything at all, isn’t as easy as it was back before it all fell down.\" ","#","^speaker blue","/#","\n","^\"Not bad of a guess you got there! Then again, it doesn’t really require rocket science to assume that, carrying my fishing rod and all.\" ","#","^speaker mc","/#","\n","^\"Touché! I heard a couple of rumors about a passionate fisherperson in the wilds, searching for the biggest catch the apocalypse left behind - or made possible.\" ","#","^speaker blue","/#","\n","^His appearance and manner of speech does give off a sense of knowledge and wit, the type of people she wants to avoid on normal days. ","#","^speaker none","/#","\n","^Those with a hidden agenda, those who got a plan up in their sleeves. Knowing how to make the simpletons work the way just as he likes.","\n","^Could he also…?","\n","^\"A rather precise observation of yours, much painfully so.\" ","#","^speaker mc","/#","\n","^\"It’s the name of my trade, information gathering and dealing with the needs of the people - for the right compensation, of course.\" ","#","^speaker blue","/#","\n","^\"If that’s the case, you surely got a clue of the whereabouts of my lost belongings, as smart as you’re presenting yourself to me.\" ","#","^speaker mc","/#","\n","^\"About that…\" ","#","^speaker blue","/#","\n","^In a for her unexpected sight to see, he seems to be lost in thought. “Caught you!”, she concludes. ","#","^speaker none","/#","\n","^\"Now that’s a telltale sign, right out of the textbook! I bet you took my stuff while I wasn’t looking because another fisher out there wanted to sabotage me badly. ","#","^speaker mc","/#","\n","^How much did they pay you for, huh?!\"","\n","^\"Wait lass, wait a moment!, stuttering in a manner that breaks her previous understanding of his character a little. ","#","^speaker blue","/#","\n","^I wouldn’t stoop so low as to resort to robbing of all things - there are much more appropriate ways to get the objects someone desires.","\n","^And speaking of desirable objects, you have to know that I found myself in a similar situation like yours, with someone taking advantage of my rare carelessness to lighten myself of my prized jewelry.\"","\n","^\"My perception of you dampens with every word coming out of your mouth\", she jokes.
